# StereogrammerOS
Application for generating stereogram images.

There are two versions of the app:

## A web version that can be run in your browser:
https://machinewrapped.github.io/StereogrammerOS/

## A Windows native .NET application
Download Stereogrammer64.zip and unzip/install.

# Stereogrammer

My final-year project at University was a program to generate Autostereograms, which at the time were enjoying a period of popularity. The end result was a Win95 application which could generate Autostereogram images (i.e. 2D images in which depth can be perceived by a trick of focussing the eyes), using random dot textures or any arbitrary bitmap.  My research into the psychology and mathematics behind the Autostereogram resulted in a new algorithm for their generation, which I named the Horoptic algorithm, and which – to my eyes at least – produces better results than the existing algorithms I discovered at the time.

I wanted another project to help me learn C# and .NET (specifically, Windows Presentation Foundation this time), so I decided to update my project.  The result is Stereogrammer, which is a rather improved version of my final year project – albeit one with much the same end results.

7 years later I tasked Claude with creating a Web version, which it did with ease.

Whether anybody out there still cares about the Autostereogram and would appreciate a utility for generating them remains to be discovered!
